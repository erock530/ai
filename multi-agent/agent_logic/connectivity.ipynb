It is there, that I was contacted by one of the professors to take a part in the first Polish AI Olympics that they are organising (january 2024). For the next few months we were creating tasks, formula of the competition, giving lectures and workshops which made me one of the seven members of the Scientific Committee. We organized two stages of that olympiad which give us the ranking of the best Polish highschool students in domain of AI and Data Science. With that team we flew to two international olympiads. One in Bulgaria (team contest), one in Saudi Arabia (individual contest). In both cases we as country scored the highest.

This reflection can help clarify what brings you satisfaction.\\n\\n2. *Structured \"\"\"Me Time\"\"\"*: Identify a hobby or interest you’ve put aside (perhaps something creative or athletic) and set aside 30 minutes to an hour on a specific day to engage in it. This could be anything from painting to playing a musical instrument.\\n\\n3. *Reconnect with Nature*: Make it a point to take your dog for longer walks in different parks or natural settings in and around Kraków. Set a goal to explore a new park or hiking trail every week.\\n\\n### This Week\\n\\n4. *Socialize with a Purpose*: Plan a get-together with friends or colleagues. Instead of a simple hangout, organize a themed night—like a cooking session or a board game night.

Choose activities that allow for both adventure and quality time together.\\n\\n8. *Community Engagement*: Look for local volunteer opportunities that align with your interests or expertise. This can provide a sense of fulfillment and connection to your community.\\n\\n### Long-Term Strategies\\n\\n9. *Set Clear Goals*: Take some time to outline both short-term and long-term personal goals.

Here are some key principles to guide your mindset:\\n\\n### 1. *Intrinsic Motivation*\\n   Cultivate a genuine interest in your goals by connecting them to your personal values and passions. Ask yourself why the goal matters to you beyond external rewards like recognition or money. Finding joy in the process rather than just the outcome leads to sustained motivation.\\n\\n### 2. *Set Realistic and Specific Goals*\\n   Frame your goals using the SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). This clarity makes them more manageable and allows you to track progress effectively, helping maintain motivation as you experience small successes along the way.\\n\\n### 3. *Embrace the Process*\\n   Shift your focus from the end result to the journey itself. Appreciate the skills and growth you acquire while pursuing your goals. Celebrating incremental progress helps keep you motivated and makes the efforts feel worthwhile.\\n\\n### 4. *Cultivate a Growth Mindset*\\n   View challenges as opportunities to learn rather than obstacles. Embracing a growth mindset encourages resilience and keeps you motivated through setbacks, reinforcing the idea that effort can lead to improvement.\\n\\n### 5. *Create a Supportive Environment*\\n   Surround yourself with positive influences—friends, mentors, or supportive communities that inspire you. Sharing your goals can create accountability and provide encouragement, enhancing your motivation.\\n\\n### 6. *Practice Self-Compassion*\\n   Be kind to yourself during challenging times. Acknowledge that fluctuations in motivation are normal and allow yourself to regroup without harsh judgment. This self-compassion helps maintain a positive outlook.\\n\\n### 7. *Establish Consistent Routines*\\n   Develop daily or weekly routines that incorporate steps toward your goals. Consistency helps build momentum and makes motivation feel more instinctive, allowing you to focus on progress rather than intensity.\\n\\n### 8. *Visualize Success and Define Your \"\"\"Why\"\"\"*\\n   Spend time visualizing your desired outcomes and the emotions connected to achieving them. Regularly revisit the reasons behind your goals to reconnect with your motivations and reignite your passion.\\n\\n### 9. *Stay Flexible and Adaptable*\\n   Accept that life circumstances may change and adjust your goals as necessary. Being open to change reduces frustration and promotes a proactive approach to your aspirations.\\n\\n### 10. *Celebrate Progress Regularly*\\n   Acknowledge and celebrate your achievements, no matter their size. Recognizing your progress reinforces positive feelings about your journey and helps sustain motivation over the long term.\\n\\nBy incorporating these practices into your approach to motivation, you create a balanced and fulfilling path toward achieving your goals. Remember, motivation is not solely about reaching the destination; it\\'''s also about enjoying and learning from the journey along the way.'''}, {'''role''': '''user''', '''parts''': '''How to find novelty in life?

Consider tricks like \"high five\", \"shake\" or \"speak\", then build up to more complex ones as they progress. \n",
      "* **Dog-Friendly Explore Day:**  Once a month, choose a new dog-friendly park, trail, or outdoor space in Kraków for a walk or adventure. This allows you to experience new places and lets your dogs explore new scents and sights.\n",
      "* **Rotating Playtime:**  Instead of always using the same toys, rotate them weekly. This creates novelty for the dogs, keeping them engaged. You can even try new activities like hide-and-seek, fetch with different objects, or agility training.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Shared Experiences with the Dogs:**\n",

      "* **\"Dog Day Out\" with Friends:** Plan a dog-friendly outing with other dog-owning friends - a picnic in the park, a trip to a dog-friendly cafe, or even a short hike. This can be a social outing for you and a fun time for your dogs.\n",
      "* **Weekend Dog \"Date Night\"**:  Once a month, set aside a special time for each dog, taking one out on a solo adventure or for a fun activity like swimming or visiting a dog-friendly store. \n",
      "* **Dog-Themed Movie Night:**  Pick a movie with dogs as protagonists (or just a movie you enjoy) and share it with your pups.  You can even create a cozy space with blankets and dog-friendly treats for a special night in.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Novelty for You and the Dogs:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Try New Treats and Toys:**  Explore dog-friendly bakeries or shops in Kraków and try a new treat or toy every now and then. It's a way to introduce something new to your routine and keep things interesting. \n",
      "* **Learn a New Dog-Related Skill:**  Pick up a skill related to dog care, like dog grooming, basic dog massage, or canine first aid. This can enhance your connection with your dogs and give you a new challenge.\n",
      "* **Dog-Friendly Volunteering:**  Look for opportunities to volunteer with dogs, perhaps at a local shelter or dog rescue. This is a fantastic way to give back and bond with dogs in need. \n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Keep the Novelty Consistent:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **\"Novelty Board\"**:  Create a physical or digital board where you can brainstorm ideas for dog-related activities, new training tricks, new treats to try, or even new dog-themed movies.\n",
      "* **Weekly Planning:**  Take a few minutes each week to plan some \"novelty\" experiences for you and your dogs, even if it's just a short 15-minute play session with a new toy. \n",
      "* **Document Your Adventures:**  Keep a journal or create a photo album of your dog-related adventures. This helps you appreciate how far you've come and keeps the novelty going.\n",
      "\n",
      "By focusing on both your personal interests and those of your furry companions, you can create a vibrant and engaging life filled with shared experiences and moments of discovery.
